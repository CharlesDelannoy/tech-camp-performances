# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Basic seed data - use the tech_camp_performance:seed rake task for exercise-specific performance testing data
